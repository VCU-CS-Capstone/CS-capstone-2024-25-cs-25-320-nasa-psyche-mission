# *AR/WebXR for Public Engagement*
## *Sponsoring Company: NASA*
## *Short Project Description*
This project is part of the NASA Psyche mission, which focuses on studying the metal-rich asteroid, Psyche, located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The mission involves using an orbiter to collect data about the asteroid, with no landing planned. The spacecraft launched in October 2023 and will arrive at Psyche in mid-2029.

To enhance public engagement, a large-scale 3D-printed model of the asteroid has been created. QR codes on the model enable museum visitors and students to use their smartphones to simulate orbiting the asteroid and collecting data. This AR/WebXR project aims to develop engaging augmented reality (AR) or WebXR experiences for users, explaining different aspects of the Psyche mission. The final projects will be featured on NASAâ€™s Psyche website and shared with the Museum & Informal Education Alliance for educational use worldwide.

The directory structure in this GitHub is to allow the project to have all its resources self-contained.
Open Source software should not just be a repository of code.  There are a number of directories to help you and others who will 
follow in your footsteps.  It'll also allow the Linux Foundation OMP Mentorship program to keep track of your project and get
a better understanding of the problems you encountered during the development of this project. 

| Folder | Description |
|---|---|
| Documentation |  all documentation the project team has created to describe the architecture, design, installation, and configuration of the project |
