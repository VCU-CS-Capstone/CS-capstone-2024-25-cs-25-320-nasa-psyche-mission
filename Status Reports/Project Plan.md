**Project:**
AR/WebXR for Public Engagement

**Project Description:**
This project is part of the NASA Psyche mission, which focuses on studying the metal-rich asteroid, Psyche, located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The mission involves using an orbiter to collect data about the asteroid, with no landing planned. The spacecraft launched in October 2023 and will arrive at Psyche in mid-2029.

To enhance public engagement, a large-scale 3D-printed model of the asteroid has been created. QR codes on the model enable museum visitors and students to use their smartphones to simulate orbiting the asteroid and collecting data. This AR/WebXR project aims to develop engaging augmented reality (AR) or WebXR experiences for users, explaining different aspects of the Psyche mission. The final projects will be featured on NASAâ€™s Psyche website and shared with the Museum & Informal Education Alliance for educational use worldwide. The team wants to create a user expiernce in AR to help people connect with the mission, once they scan a qr code it will send them to a web game for them to learn about our mission while having fun!

**Problem Definition:**
Create a Ar or WebXR expierince relating to the psyche mission

**Deliverables**
One or more AR or WebXR expiernce
